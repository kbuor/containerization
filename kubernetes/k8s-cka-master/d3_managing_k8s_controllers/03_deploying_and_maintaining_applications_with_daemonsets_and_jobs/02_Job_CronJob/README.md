## Executing tasks with Jobs, check out the file job.yaml
- Ensure you define a `restartPolicy`, the default of a Pod is `Always`, which is not compatible with a Job.
We'll need `OnFailure` or `Never`, let's look at `OnFailure`
```
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
job.batch/hello-world-job created
```

- Follow job status with a watch
```
kubectl get job --watch

NAME              COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hello-world-job   1/1           8s         16s
```

- Get the list of `Pods`, status is `Completed` and `Ready` is 0/1
```
kubectl get pods

NAME                    READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-job-trd68   0/1     Completed   0          67s
```

- Let's get some more details about the job `labels`, `selectors`, `Start Time`, `Duration` and `Pod Statuses`
```
kubectl describe job hello-world-job

- Get the logs from stdout from the Job Pod
```
kubectl get pods -l job-name=hello-world-job

hello-world-job-trd68   0/1     Completed   0          3m56s

kubectl logs hello-world-job-trd68
Hello from Pod hello-world-job-trd68 at Fri Aug 18 15:51:05 UTC 2023
```

- Our Job is completed, but it's up to use to delete the Pod or the Job.
```
kubectl delete job hello-world-job
```

- Which will also delete it's `Pods`
```
kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```

## Show `restartPolicy` in action, check out `backoffLimit: 2` and `restartPolicy: Never`
- We'll want to use `Never` so our pods aren't deleted after `backoffLimit` is reached.
```
kubectl apply -f job-failure-OnFailure.yaml
```

- Let's look at the pods, enters a backoffloop after 2 crashes
```
kubectl get pods --watch
NAME                         READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-job-fail-gbfcn   0/1     Error    0          46s
hello-world-job-fail-hktlg   0/1     Error    0          21s
hello-world-job-fail-wwjb2   0/1     Error    0          61s
```
- The pods aren't deleted so we can troubleshoot here if needed.
And the job won't have any completions and it doesn't get deleted
```
kubectl get jobs 
```

- So let's review what the job did
```
kubectl describe jobs | more

## Defining aÂ Parallel Job
```
kubectl apply -f ParallelJob.yaml

- 10 Pods will run in parallel up until 50 completions

```

- We can 'watch' the `Statuses` with watch
```
watch 'kubectl describe job | head -n 11'
```

- We'll get to 50 completions very quickly
```
kubectl get jobs
NAME                       COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hello-world-job-parallel   50/50         35s        2m4s
```

- Let's clean up...
```
kubectl delete job hello-world-job-parallel
```


## Scheduling tasks with `CronJobs`
```
kubectl apply -f CronJob.yaml
cronjob.batch/hello-world-cron created
```

- Quick overview of the job and it's schedule
```
kubectl get cronjobs

hello-world-cron   */1 * * * *   False     1        2s              20s
```

- But let's look closer at `Schedule`, `Concurrency`, `Suspend`,`Starting Deadline Seconds`, `Events`
```

```
kubectl get pods --watch
